# Who Are Palmer's Penguins?

## Project Overiveiw

The goal of this app is to learn about penguins from many different locations. Although the app doesn't necessarily solve a tangible problem, it is an excellent example for users to understand and engage with Streamlit software. This app specifically allows users to manipulate the platform such that they can learn about different species and sizes of penguins, including where they're from!

## What's in the dataset:
- species
- island
- bill length (mm)
- bill depth (mm)
- flipper length (mm)
- body mass (g)
- sex

## How to use the app:

### Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- penguins.vsv

To ensure the above requirements are installed, run this command in your terminal:
```
{
    pip install streamlit
    pip install pandas
}
```

To run the app locally, use this command:
```
{
    streamlit run main.py
}
```
