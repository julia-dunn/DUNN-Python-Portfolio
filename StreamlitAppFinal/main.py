st.write("Welcome to the best new app for university physics students. This app is built to help you with your introductory physics lab. Many students, myself included, spend the first semester in lab calculating the acceleration due to gravity in 4 different ways: with a pendulum, in free fall, with an Atwood machine, or on an incline. But which is the most accurate?")

Uncertainty calculations are essential for the scientific method because they demonstrate the uncertainty of an experiment without human error, that is if done perfectly.

st.write("But what is uncertainty? And how is it calculated?")
st.write("The uncertainty of a value depends on the uncertainty of the measurements that make up the calculation. When completing an experiment, there is fundamental uncertainty due to the tools you use. For example, when you measure length with a typical ruler, the smallest increment marked is 1/16 of an inch. Because of this, there is an uncertainty in your measurement of about 1/32 of an inch. Then, when you calculate a value based on multiple measurements, the uncertainty of those measurements can be propagated into an overall uncertainty. The equation is as follows:")
