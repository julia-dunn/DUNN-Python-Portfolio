# Final Streamlit App README
## Physics Right of Passage: Calculating 'g'

Welcome to the home page README for my final project, a streamlit app related to the field that interests me. I chose to create an app that is incredibly useful for introductory phsycis and scientific exploration. In most university Physics 1 courses, there is a lab component in which students use many experimental methods to calculate the accelerationd ue to gravity on Earth. They have to use the scientific method to create in depth lab reports that are, at times, tedious considering the content is not the most "earth-shattering." 

One aspect of these reports that is incredibly important is uncertainty.
