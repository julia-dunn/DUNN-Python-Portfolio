# Final Streamlit App README
## Physics Right of Passage: Calculating 'g'

### Project Overview 

Welcome to the home page README for my final project, a streamlit app related to the field that interests me. I chose to create an app that is incredibly useful for introductory phsycis and scientific exploration. In most university Physics 1 courses, there is a lab component in which students use many experimental methods to calculate the accelerationd ue to gravity on Earth. They have to use the scientific method to create in depth lab reports that are, at times, tedious considering the content is not the most "earth-shattering." 

One aspect of these reports that is incredibly important is uncertainty. Uncertainty of a value depends on the uncertainty of measurements that make up the calculation. Fundamentally, tools used to measure values have uncertainty because they can only be marked to a specific increment. Thus, when you calculate a value based on many measurements, those uncertainties must be propagated to understand the overall uncertainty of your calculations. These calculations can be challenging and time consuming, especially for those with a limited understanding of calculus. The purpose of this app is to provide introductory physics students with a platform where they can build these skills and test their own uncertainty calculations. In addition, the platform demonstrates, through visualizations, how uncertainty does not always account for inaccuracy. When this happens, which is often, there is likely either a systematic problem with the experimental method or substantial human error. 

The first method typically used a simple pendulum, for which the acceleration due to gravity can be calculated with the period of the pendulum and the length of the spring. Depicted below is what it may look like in a professional lab.

The second method typically used is freefall. Everyone knows that when you drop something, it falls to the ground. In fact, regardless of the mass of an object (in a perfect, air-resistence-less world tha is), all objects fall with the same acceleration (g). By dropping small, smooth objects, like marbles, at different heights, you can once again calculate the acceleration due to gravity.

Third is the Atwood Machine, a much more complicated setup that demonstrates how different sized masses attached by a pulley accelerate in g. This, once again, gives students the opportunity to make more complicated calculations because of the number of measurements invlved. Depicted below is a typical atwood setup.

Finally, an incline. Once again, most people are familiar with the idea that when you roll something, like a marble, down a hill, it will accelerate. It is more complicated, however, when you consider the rotational energy in addition to the translational kinetic energy the object gains. That factor, once again, makes calculations for g slightly more complicated than the typical free fall.
