# Dunn-Python-Portfolio
 Python Portfolio for Elements of Computing II and Streamlit 

#### Purpose of Repository:

This repository will be used to store future computing projects from the course Elements of Computing II such that I will have a tangible final product following the completion of the course. I hope to not only have an organized GitHub page with a clear representation of my work, but also a developed understanding of GitHub and how to create a polished portfolio. 

#### Plan for Organizing Future Projects

Within this repository, I'd like to remain structured and organized such that both I and a future empployer, professor etc. am able to easily access and understand all of the content. Thus, I will have specific pages for each realm of computing, i.e. data analytics, development. Furthermore, I'd like to use visualizations to make the page more interesting. One thing I hope to add to this page is my experience using python to reogranize a model through the ND Physics department. A picture of the St. George recoil seperator, which was very relevant to my project, may not only provide context but also engage a viewer, encouraging them to look deeper. 

#### Projects

##### [Who are Palmer's Penguins?](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/beeb0c519df8e911a2f0b83560ebc9edb7912d2f/basic-streamlit-app)

Use this app to learn more about Palmer's Penguins: who they are and where they came from. Penguins are one of the most interesting animals and as you interact with this platform, I hope you are intruiged by how the statistical information demonstrates their demographic.

##### [Tidy Data Project: Federal Research and Development Budget](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/3575b25a9349fec8471f8504f0438e34ec56ffd9/TidyData-Project)

This jupiter notebook uses tidy data principles to clean and analyze data regarding the federal allocation of the research and development budgets across different departments. This dataset considers data from 1976 to 2017, providing data regarding many different departments. The goal of my project was to tidy the data and complete some data analysis to demonstrate the importance of tidy data such that it can be undestood logically. 

This project, overall, is valuable to my portfolio because it demonstrates my data tidying and manipulation skills, as well as my emphasis on understanding *why* data is represented a specific way.
