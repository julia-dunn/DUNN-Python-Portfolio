# Dunn-Python-Portfolio
 Python Portfolio for Elements of Computing II and Streamlit 

#### Purpose of Repository:

This repository will be used to store future computing projects from the course Elements of Computing II such that I will have a tangible final product following the completion of the course. I hope to not only have an organized GitHub page with a clear representation of my work, but also a developed understanding of GitHub and how to create a polished portfolio. 

#### Plan for Organizing Future Projects

Within this repository, I'd like to remain structured and organized such that both I and a future empployer, professor etc. am able to easily access and understand all of the content. Thus, I will have specific pages for each realm of computing, i.e. data analytics, development. Furthermore, I'd like to use visualizations to make the page more interesting. One thing I hope to add to this page is my experience using python to reogranize a model through the ND Physics department. A picture of the St. George recoil seperator, which was very relevant to my project, may not only provide context but also engage a viewer, encouraging them to look deeper. 

#### Projects

##### [Who are Palmer's Penguins?](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/beeb0c519df8e911a2f0b83560ebc9edb7912d2f/basic-streamlit-app)

Use this app to learn more about Palmer's Penguins: who they are and where they came from. Penguins are one of the most interesting animals and as you interact with this platform, I hope you are intruiged by how the statistical information demonstrates their demographic.

##### [Tidy Data Project: Federal Research and Development Budget](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/3575b25a9349fec8471f8504f0438e34ec56ffd9/TidyData-Project)

This jupiter notebook uses tidy data principles to clean and analyze data regarding the federal allocation of the research and development budgets across different departments. This dataset considers data from 1976 to 2017, providing data regarding many different departments. The goal of my project was to tidy the data and complete some data analysis to demonstrate the importance of tidy data such that it can be undestood logically. 

This project, overall, is valuable to my portfolio because it demonstrates my data tidying and manipulation skills, as well as my emphasis on understanding *why* data is represented a specific way.

##### [NER App Project](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp)

This streamlit app ties together my new language processing skills and my knowledge of Streamlit as a developing language. I have used spaCy to create an app which allows users to complete named entity recognition of text files with custom entity rulers. This is interesting because it takes into account the nuances from user interaction, such as extra spaces or empty inputs, and is still able to correctly detect entities. 

This project is valuable to my portfolio because it demonstrates my user focused approach to the task. Furthermore, it demonstrates a wide range of skills and an ability to connect ideas which are seemingly unconnected. Although we learned Streamlit entirely separately from spaCy, I was able to connect the two and create a usable platform. 

##### [Physics Right of Passage](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal)

This streamlit app allows users to input experimental data and engage with basic summaries and analytics. The app is aimed for students in introductory physics, during which they often have to complete many similar experiments to calculate the acceleration due to gravity, as well as error and uncertainty. The goal of building this app was not only to develop my own skills in data analytics on the streamlit platform, but also to create something actually usable that serves a relevant purpose to my field.

This app was especially exciting for me because it pushed me to learn new skills that I could use in future environments. Not only is this app helpful to physics students to come, I anticipate sharing it with the students I tutor to demonstrate the value computing can bring to people's lives and careers. Within the field of data science, I am most interested in the analytical/calculation based applications, as opposed to machine learning or language processing, so this app gave me the opportunity to pursue that curiosity.
