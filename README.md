 Python Portfolio for Elements of Computing II and Streamlit 
# DUNN-Python-Portfolio

#### Purpose of Repository:

This repository will be used to store future computing projects from the course Elements of Computing II such that I will have a tangible final product following the completion of the course. I hope to not only have an organized GitHub page with a clear representation of my work, but also a developed understanding of GitHub and how to create a polished portfolio. 

#### Plan for Organizing Future Projects

Within this repository, I'd like to remain structured and organized such that both I and a future empployer, professor etc. am able to easily access and understand all of the content. Thus, I will have specific pages for each realm of computing, i.e. data analytics, development. Furthermore, I'd like to use visualizations to make the page more interesting. One thing I hope to add to this page is my experience using python to reogranize a model through the ND Physics department. A picture of the St. George recoil seperator, which was very relevant to my project, may not only provide context but also engage a viewer, encouraging them to look deeper.
