# Dunn-Python-Portfolio
 Python Portfolio for Elements of Computing II and Streamlit 

#### Purpose of Repository:

This repository is a landing page for the projects I have created throughout the course Elements of Computing II at Notre Dame. We have worked with an assortent of different libraries to build skillsets for many different fields. We have used seaborn, pandas, and matplotlib for data analytics, as well as spaCy for machine learning and language processing. The goal of my portfolio is to demonstrate the fundamental computing skills I have gained, and provide an organized structure for future projects.  

#### Plan for Organizing Future Projects

The organization of this portfolio is such that future employers, professors, admissions committees and the like can easily access the scripts I have developed. In addition, there are detailed README pages which provide explanations and examples of the purpose of my projects and how they are used. This portfolio includes not only my computational projects, but information about why they are valuable and how they demonstrate my potential contributions to projects and corporations alike. 

#### Projects at a Glance

##### [Who are Palmer's Penguins?](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/beeb0c519df8e911a2f0b83560ebc9edb7912d2f/basic-streamlit-app)

Use this app to learn more about Palmer's Penguins: who they are and where they came from. Penguins are one of the most interesting animals and as you interact with this platform, I hope you are intruiged by how the statistical information demonstrates their demographic.

This project is valuable because it allowed me to develop introductory skills in building a platform. It forced me to use and undestand specific syntax required for formatting and user interaction. As I have continued to develop projects, such as the NER app and the Physics app, I have find it valuable to look back to where I started and what I have learned.

##### [Tidy Data Project: Federal Research and Development Budget](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/3575b25a9349fec8471f8504f0438e34ec56ffd9/TidyData-Project)

This jupiter notebook uses tidy data principles to clean and analyze data regarding the federal allocation of the research and development budgets across different departments. This dataset considers data from 1976 to 2017, providing data regarding many different departments. The goal of my project was to tidy the data and complete some data analysis to demonstrate the importance of tidy data such that it can be undestood logically. 

This project, overall, is valuable to my portfolio because it demonstrates my data tidying and manipulation skills, as well as my emphasis on understanding *why* data is represented a specific way.

##### [NER App Project](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp)

This streamlit app ties together my new language processing skills and my knowledge of Streamlit as a developing language. I have used spaCy to create an app which allows users to complete named entity recognition of text files with custom entity rulers. This is interesting because it takes into account the nuances from user interaction, such as extra spaces or empty inputs, and is still able to correctly detect entities. 

This project is valuable to my portfolio because it demonstrates my user focused approach to the task. Furthermore, it demonstrates a wide range of skills and an ability to connect ideas which are seemingly unconnected. Although we learned Streamlit entirely separately from spaCy, I was able to connect the two and create a usable platform. 

##### [Physics Right of Passage](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal)

This streamlit app allows users to input experimental data and engage with basic summaries and analytics. The app is aimed for students in introductory physics, during which they often have to complete many similar experiments to calculate the acceleration due to gravity, as well as error and uncertainty. The goal of building this app was not only to develop my own skills in data analytics on the streamlit platform, but also to create something actually usable that serves a relevant purpose to my field.

This app was especially exciting for me because it pushed me to learn new skills that I could use in future environments. Not only is this app helpful to physics students to come, I anticipate sharing it with the students I tutor to demonstrate the value computing can bring to people's lives and careers. Within the field of data science, I am most interested in the analytical/calculation based applications, as opposed to machine learning or language processing, so this app gave me the opportunity to pursue that curiosity.
